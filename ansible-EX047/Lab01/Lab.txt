Your supervisor has asked you to find a way to automate and audit basic system configuration for new servers in your environment. 
Given that Ansible is already configured at a basic level in your environment, the simplest solution would be to just write a playbook for bootstrapping your new hosts. 
Create a playbook called /home/ansible/bootstrap.yml to fulfill the following boot strap requirements:

All servers:

Edit /etc/hosts to include the following entry:
ansible.xyzcorp.com  169.168.0.1
Install elinks
Create the user xyzcorp_audit
Copy the files /home/ansible/motd and /home/ansible/issue to /etc/
Network servers:

Install nmap-ncat
Create the user xyzcorp_network
SysAdmin servers:

Copy /home/ansible/scripts.tgz from the control node to /mnt/storage
The Ansible control node has been configured for you and each testing server has already been configured for use with Ansible. 
The default inventory has been configured to include a the groups network and sysadmin. Each group includes a sample host.
