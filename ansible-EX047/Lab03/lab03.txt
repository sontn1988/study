You must create a modular playbook used for webserver management. Create a playbook called /home/ansible/webserver.yml that meets the following requirements:

On the host group webservers:

Deploy httpd.
You can assume all necessary firewall rules have been deployed.
Start and enable httpd.
Configure virtual host using the provided templates in /home/ansible/vhost.conf.j2 and /home/ansible/htpasswd.j2.
Note: The template references a variable defined in /home/ansible/confidential which must be included as a variable file in your playbook.
Use ansible vault to secure /home/ansible/confidential with password "I love ansible".
Run the data job stored in /opt/data-job.sh on each node in webservers asynchronously, without polling for status.
Create tags for the following tasks:
base-intall for httpd installation and service configuration.
vhost for virtual host deployment.
data-job to execute the asynchronous data job.
The Ansible control node has been configured for you and each webserver has already been configured for use with Ansible. The default inventory has been configured to include the webservers group and sample hosts.
